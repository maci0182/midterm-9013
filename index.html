                <p>orem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are morI think the only card she has is the Lorem card. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina</p>
                <p>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I know words. I have the best words. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.</p>
                <p>I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</p>

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. You’re disgusting.</p>
                <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.</p>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
